# NeuroPattToolbox
Neuropatt is a MATLAB toolbox to automatically detect, analyze and visualize spatiotemporal patterns in neural population activity. Data recorded by multi-electrode arrays, EEG, MEG, fMRI and other imaging methods such as VSD can optionally be filtered to extract the phase or amplitude of oscillations within a specified frequency range. Propagating activity is then extracted adapting methods from the fields of turbulence fluid and computer vision. Spatiotemporal patterns can be tracked across space and time using order parameter and critical point analysis, and dominant spatiotemporal dynamics are extracted using vector field decompositions.

NeuroPatt comes with a collection of user-friendly Matlab functions that allow for (1) automatic detection of all spatiotemporal patterns in an input recording based on user parameters, (2) output and visualization (plots and videos) of pattern statistics, (3) and analysis and visualization of pattern dynamics.
